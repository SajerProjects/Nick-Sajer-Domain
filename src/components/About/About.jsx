        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Nick Sajer. I'm 22 and based in New York City. AI is
          reshaping everything — and I want to be at the center of it. I spend
          my time building companies, studying markets, and going deep on the
          technology that's changing how we live and work. I care about staying
          sharp physically and mentally, and I'm drawn to people with ambition,
          ideas with leverage, and problems worth solving.

        <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently building specialized AI software infrastructure designed
          to help enterprises and consumers work smarter, move faster, and
          unlock capabilities that didn't exist a few years ago. I'm focused on
          creating tools that don't just use AI as a feature — but are built
          from the ground up with it at the core.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside that, I run an education platform dedicated to making AI
          accessible. The goal is simple: help people understand what AI
          actually is, how it works, and most importantly — how to leverage it
          in their careers, businesses, and daily lives. I believe the biggest
          gap in AI right now isn't the technology — it's the understanding.
